## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **Data Loading:** Reads structured vehicle dataset (likely from Kaggle).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uses libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Label Encoding for categorical features (`model`, `transmission`, `fuelType`)
  - StandardScaler for normalization
- **Model Building:**
  - Linear Regression
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - RÂ² and Adjusted RÂ²
